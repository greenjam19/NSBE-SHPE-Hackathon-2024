As far as pattern matching algorithms are concerned, before anyone could get to finding out
what untapped career paths tailor to your resume the best, some data extraction would need to occur first.

At the very least someone would need to take all relevant text from a resume you've submitted, and pass
it against a handful of "tags" associated with each job currently listed on the O & O site at that time.

A quick script of just the parsing of such a pdf is shown below:

import PyPDF2, re
#Dependency: pip install PyPDF2
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    text = ""
    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        num_pages = len(reader.pages)
        for page_num in range(num_pages):
            page = reader.pages[page_num]
            ptext = page.extract_text()
            print(re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9\s]+', '', ptext)) #<------ Nets you a filtered scrape (only alphanumerics 
                                                        # and spaces)
            print("\n\n")
            text += page.extract_text()
    return text

pdf_path = "Jamarri_Green_Spring2024_Resume.pdf"  # <------ You can replace this with any resume PDF file, this is 
                                                  # just the in-drive name for my own.
extracted_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
print(extracted_text) #<------ Nets you a standard scrape.



In the end the filtered scrape (below) would be the best candidate for word partitioning/ word comparisons
or even something more sophisticated like TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) vectorized
word comparisons 

(essentially a formula that converts text documents into vectors based on the relevancy of the words 
contained within)
