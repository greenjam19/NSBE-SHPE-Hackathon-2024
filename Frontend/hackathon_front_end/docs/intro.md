# Why Opulence & Opportunities?

Opulence & Opportunities is a resource for underrepresented communities to be exposed to new fields and the requirements to get started. By providing a centralized resource for all of this information, we'll collectively be able to break down the barriers for entry.

## Core Mission

* **Expose individuals from underrepresented communities to diverse and fulfilling career paths** they may not have previously considered.
* **Demystify the requirements and entry points** for these fields, making them more accessible and attainable.
* **Collectively dismantle the systemic obstacles** that hinder equal access to opportunity and success.
