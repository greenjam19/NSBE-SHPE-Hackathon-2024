# NSBE-SHPE-Hackathon-2024
This repository's purpose is to serve as a frame of reference for everything that Matthew L Merritt and myself decide to delve into while fleshing out our project 
for a Hackathon hosted by our campus' very own chapters of NSBE and SHPE. More general info coming later today!
